            The ocean impacts and has impacted profoundly many societies and their cultures around the world. Many coastal communities build their identity, traditions and lifestyles around their proximity to the ocean. If you’re interested in getting to know a variety of traditions and beliefs different from your own, this might be a very interesting section for you! 
<br>
            The ocean often has a strong religious and spiritual meaning to different cultures, frequently being associated with gods, myths or practices. Some of them even associate water with healing, purification and renewal. These traditions and beliefs are usually passed through generations and end up establishing the community’s culture.

            The sea also impacts different societies’ art, literature and culinary. It is constantly a theme in paintings, drawings, poems, texts, stories and other art forms, and can be romanticized and interpreted as a source of mystery and unknown, an adventure, an escape from the world, a source of beauty and diversity, etc. The culinary of coastal societies is also really influenced by the availability of the huge variety of seafood. These culinary dishes and recipes also make up part of a society’s culture. 
<br>
            For example, the Maori people, from New Zealand, associate the ocean with many gods, rituals and myths. Tangaroa is the god of the sea, son of the god of the Sky, Ranginui, and of the goddess of the Earth, Papatūānuku. He is an important part of this society’s mythology.

    <p style="font-size: 25px;margin:30px">In Shinto, a religion originated in Japan, the ocean is also associated with divine elements: for them, natural elements, including the ocean, are considered sacred. The sea is associated with kami, supernatural beings (spirits or divinities) that have powers. The sound of waves, the movement of tides, and the beauty of the ocean are elements of divine presence.
        <br><br>
        Their cuisine is also globally known for its many uses of fish and seafood, including dishes such as sushi, sashimi, temaki, etc.
            Lastly, followers of the Yoruba religion, practiced mainly in West Africa, often express their connection with the ocean through art, music and dance. That is, we can find different representations of water elements in their traditional art.
            <br><br>
        That way, it is remarkable that the sea impacts and influences cultures and communities all over the world.
