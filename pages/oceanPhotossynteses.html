	You might know that in the ocean there are thousands of organisms that compose a very diverse ecosystem. Scientists have registered about 240.000 marine species, but they estimate that about 2.2 million species exist in the Earth’s oceans. But how do those organisms impact us?
<br>
In the ocean, there are thousands of organisms that perform photosynthesis (like phytoplankton or the many different algae species) and, therefore, absorb and store CO2 in order to produce energy and survive. 
<br>
Since CO2 is a greenhouse gas, it contributes to global warming: amongst other gases, carbon dioxide allows sunlight into our atmosphere but doesn’t let a big part of it get out. Therefore, the temperature of our planet increases.

            That way, when marine organisms absorb carbon dioxide, they help reduce global warming, a phenomenon that’s directly affecting the temperature of our planet daily. When they die, some of this gas sinks to the bottom of the ocean and sediments, which helps mitigate the impact of human carbon emissions and also contributes to the carbon cycle.
            <br>
            These photosynthetic organisms also release oxygen into the atmosphere and into the water when performing photosynthesis. It is estimated that phytoplankton and marine species are responsible for about half of the world’s oxygen production, which means they are just as important as terrestrial plants and forests.
            <br>
             That means, the oceans and the species living in it reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air we breathe and increase the amount of oxygen in it significantly.
