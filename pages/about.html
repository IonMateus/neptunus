        The ocean is one of nature's greatest mysteries. Over the years, decades, centuries, 
        the exploration of this incredible ecosystem has always been an enigma, given the 
        vastness and depth of the oceans and seas.

            Imagine you visit a landlocked region where none of the inhabitants have ever been to the ocean. Although they may not be aware of it, every single day these people breathe oxygen generated by marine photosynthesis, benefit from the lowered atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels induced by marine phytoplankton, and consume food that was fueled by marine ecosystems. In essence, the ocean can be viewed as a garden that provides beauty, resources, and CO2 drawdown for society.
