            Oceans also have a very important participation in human economic activities. Coastal areas’ economies usually benefit from tourism, commercial fishing, ports and other economic activities based on the sea. 
            <br>
	You’ve probably visited a coastal city before to go to the beach or to enjoy its laisure. Oceans tend to attract tourists for recreational activities such as fishing, beach vacations, water and beach sports, cruises, etc. That way, many local businesses such as restaurants, hotels, small shops and entertainment services benefit from their proximity to the ocean.

            You've probably already eaten some sort of fish, shrimp, oyster or other marine animals as well. The oceans are a big source of seafood and, that way, they contribute to the global fishing industry. Many fishers and small local shops can also survive through the oceans' resources. 
            <br>
	Another way the economy can benefit from the oceans is through ports. Coastal cities and their ports are the point of connection between different regions in the shipping industry, and are really important to today's international trade. The ocean is a main transport route in today's globalized world and you've probably benefited from it when buying an international product, for example. 
    <br>
	There are many other ways in which the sea contributes to our economy and commercial activities, since it can be a supply of oil and gas, mineral resources, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, etc.
