    <h1 style="color: #0059ff;">Phytoplankton: what are these small organisms and how do they affect my life? </h1>

    <div id="initialBox">

            Phytoplankton are diverse microscopic organisms that help regulate the atmosphere, the climate and the ecosystems of the oceans. They can be found mostly in surface waters and, although you might not know it, impact your daily life. 
            <br><br>
            Phytoplankton are microscopic, unicellular, photosynthetic microorganisms that live in aquatic environments, such as the ocean. They are mostly found in surface waters (up to about 100 or 200 meters), since they need sunlight to photosynthesize and to survive. However, they can also be found in deeper layers of the ocean if the water is clear enough for the sunlight to reach them. 
            The word “Phytoplankton” has greek origins: “phyton” means “plant” and “planktos” means “wondering” or “drifting”.  
            There are many different life forms of phytoplankton, including photosynthetic bacteria (cyanobacteria), marine algae and others.

            Fun fact: when conditions are favorable, phytoplankton can bloom (grow explosively). This phenomenon is easily observed through satellites. Check out these images from Nasa:<br><br>

        Okay, but how do phytoplankton affect my life?
<br><br>
1. Atmosphere and climate regulation:
	Since phytoplankton are photosynthetic organisms, they consume carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. They absorb it when doing photosynthesis in order to produce energy and, when they die, some of it sinks to the bottom of the ocean. <br>
Even though that might seem insignificant, they can do it on a scale equivalent to forests and other land plants, significantly reducing the greenhouse effect on the atmosphere and, consequently, global warming. Therefore, changes in phytoplankton abundance and distribution can impact the global carbon cycle and, consequently, climate patterns. <br>
	That is, the air you're breathing right now probably has its carbon dioxide lowered by phytoplankton, and the temperature of your city is probably affected by it too. 
<br><br>
2. Water oxygenation and oxygen production:
	Over 50% of the oxygen in the atmosphere is produced by phytoplankton, since they’re photosynthetic organisms and release oxygen when obtaining energy. They also contribute to water oxygenation and, consequently, to marine ecosystems.
<br><br>
3. Foundation of the aquatic food web:
	Phytoplankton are the foundation of the aquatic ecosystem, since they’re producers (perform photosynthesis). That way, they contribute in some way to the food chain of most fish and seafood you consume in your daily life.
