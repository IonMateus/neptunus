# Neptunus
Space Apps Challenge Project - 2023

Our project is an educational website about the importance of the ocean in our lives and for the planet. Through the use of images, text, pages, subpages, GIFs, music, and fun elements, our website addresses the challenge by providing a clear and easy way to learn about the ocean and its significance, accessible to everyone as a website. The significance of our project lies in raising awareness of the ocean's role in our lives. Understanding the ocean impacts how we act towards it, thereby helping to preserve this vital part of our planet.
